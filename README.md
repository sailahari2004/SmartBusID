🚌 Bus Pass Verification System
📖 Overview

The Bus Pass Verification System is a smart and secure solution designed to automate the process of verifying passengers in public transportation. It integrates Face Recognition and QR Code Verification technologies to ensure reliable and efficient passenger authentication. The system aims to reduce manual intervention, prevent unauthorized access, and enhance transparency in bus pass management.

⚙️ Key Features

🔍 Face Recognition-Based Verification: Automatically identifies and verifies passengers using pre-registered facial data.

🧾 QR Code Fallback System: Allows QR-based pass verification when face recognition fails due to lighting, connectivity, or camera issues.

☁️ Cloud Database Integration: Stores passenger information, verification records, and route details securely in the cloud.

📱 User-Friendly Interface: Simple and intuitive UI for both conductors and passengers.

🕒 Real-Time Verification: Ensures instant validation and updates of passenger attendance.

📊 Verification Logs: Maintains a detailed history of all successful and failed verifications for audit and analysis.

🧠 Technologies Used

Frontend: Flutter / React Native (for mobile interface)

Backend: Node.js / Express.js

Database: Firebase / MongoDB

Face Recognition: OpenCV, DeepFace

QR Code Generation & Scanning: ZXing / Pyzbar libraries

Cloud Hosting: AWS / Firebase

🔬 System Workflow

The passenger scans their QR code or allows the system to detect their face.

The application retrieves data from the cloud database and matches it with stored credentials.

If matched successfully, the system displays a “Pass Verified Successfully” message.

In case of a mismatch, it prompts the user for QR fallback verification.

The verification record (time, date, route, user type) is stored securely for reference.

📊 Results

The system achieved high accuracy in both facial and QR-based verification processes. The fallback QR verification ensured uninterrupted authentication even under challenging conditions. The automated attendance feature reduced manual errors and improved operational efficiency in bus transportation.

🏁 Conclusion

The Bus Pass Verification System successfully demonstrates how AI and QR technologies can modernize public transport operations. By enabling automated, dual-mode verification, the system ensures high accuracy, speed, and reliability in passenger validation. It enhances security, reduces human error, and provides valuable data insights for route and passenger management. This project serves as a scalable model for future smart transportation systems, promoting digital transformation and improving commuter experience.
